## Blockchain Applications in Ruru NFT

Blockchain technology ensures the security, ownership, and decentralization of digital assets on Ruru NFT. Here's how each blockchain is used:

### 1. **Polygon**
Polygon is integrated for **scalable, low-cost transactions**. Its layer-2 solution on Ethereum allows the minting and trading of NFTs with minimal gas fees. This is ideal for users who want to purchase or transfer NFTs without the high transaction costs associated with Ethereum, especially during peak network traffic. It balances **efficiency** with **decentralization**, making NFTs affordable while maintaining security.

### 2. **Ethereum**
Ethereum is one of the most widely adopted blockchains for NFTs, ensuring **secure and decentralized ownership**. On Ruru NFT, it serves as the foundation for **minting and verifying NFTs**. Ethereum's smart contracts guarantee that the ownership of each NFT is stored immutably on the blockchain, making each transaction transparent and tamper-proof. Ethereum's global adoption enhances trust among users and collectors, offering a reliable environment for **high-value digital assets**.

### 3. **Solana**
Solana brings the benefit of **fast transactions with very low fees**, making it a strong alternative for users wanting quick interactions with the blockchain. It’s particularly useful for users who want real-time engagement with NFTs, such as purchasing or transferring assets instantly. The blockchain’s **high throughput** allows the platform to manage large volumes of transactions efficiently, reducing delays and enhancing the user experience.

### Wallets for Interaction
Ruru NFT integrates several wallets to facilitate blockchain transactions:
- **MetaMask** (Ethereum, Polygon)
- **Phantom Wallet** (Solana)
- **Torus**
- **Solflare**

These wallets store the user’s private keys and allow them to engage with NFTs by viewing, purchasing, or transferring them directly on the platform.

### Why Blockchain?
Blockchain adds multiple layers of **transparency** and **security** to digital assets. Each NFT is stored on the blockchain, ensuring that:
- Ownership can be **verified** by anyone.
- Transactions are **permanent** and **tamper-proof**.
- Creators and owners benefit from **decentralized control**, meaning no single entity can alter the NFTs or interfere with transactions.

Blockchain technology makes Ruru NFT a trustworthy and future-proof platform for digital asset collectors.

## Prerequisites
- To interact with NFTs, you will need a compatible digital wallet, such as:
  - **MetaMask**
  - **Phantom Wallet** (for Solana-based NFTs)
